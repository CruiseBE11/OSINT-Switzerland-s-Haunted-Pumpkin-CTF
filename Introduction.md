Challenge: <br>
🎃🎃🎃 The Pumpkin’s Gentle Pact 🎃🎃🎃

👀 Look, don’t touch: Should you stumble upon real souls (companies, people, socials), admire them like ghosts in a mirror. No poking, pinging, friending, or messaging… they might be cursed.

🙊 Silence is golden: No calling, DM-ing, or sliding into inboxes of anyone (living or otherwise). The dead don’t answer anyway.

🕵️ Stay ghostly: Lurk, don’t lunge. Only passive reconnaissance is allowed. If you go full hacker banshee and start scanning or probing, the pumpkin will hex your keyboard.

🤐 Pumpkin society secrets: Posting challenges online while the CTF runs? Forbidden sorcery.

🧙 Pumpkin’s Technical Mischief
The pumpkin also messed with our CTF base. Beware:

For Geo-Location challenges, it’s wiser to click on the map & use the radius than to drop exact coordinates.

To leave the Geo-Challenges, you’ll have to jump back through your browser. The pumpkin gobbled up the minimize/return buttons.

📜 What Lies Ahead
35 challenges await your brave soul.

“First Bloods” will only be included after the event — patience, young witch or warlock.

So sharpen your digital lanterns, steady your ghostly hands, and prepare to wander through shadows of the web.

Your entry flag, brave investigator, is the key into the Realm of the Pumpkin… 🎃🔑 <br>
