A few years ago, there were some people dressing up as Horror Clowns, showing up out of nowhere scaring the hell out of people as can be seen in the following staged video.

Can you find the name of the train station at minute 01:56?

## Solution

Watching the YouTube video at 01:56 gives us a good idea as to a description and screenshot of the station.

I focused on the uniqueness of the building in the background and the the yellow safetyy bars that appear to come from an entrance to the station. <br>

I found a better screenshot at 2:46 to screenshot and reverse search with Google Images.

One of the first results yields a similar structure.

Finding the image in the webpage result brings you to another page.
